Football Player Posture Analysis using Computer Vision
**Project Overview**

This project uses OpenCV and Mediapipe Pose Estimation to analyze a football player's posture. It calculates the knee angle and detects if the player's knee is collapsing (poor posture). This can be used for:

--> Injury Prevention

--> Sports Performance Analysis

--> Training Assistance

**Features**

✔ Pose Estimation using Mediapipe

✔ Knee Angle Calculation for posture evaluation

✔ Feedback on Knee Collapse

✔ Real-time Analysis (can be extended for live video)

** Dataset**(Optional)

This script works with any football player image, but a dataset of action poses could improve accuracy for real-world applications.

**Use Cases**

⚽ Football Training Analysis – Detect improper knee positioning.

🦵 Injury Prevention – Identify dangerous knee angles.

🏋️ Posture Correction – Assist in physiotherapy or fitness training.
